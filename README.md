Developed a MERN stack-based "Product Store" application that allows users to add and remove products from their wishlist. Implemented a responsive UI with React.js, RESTful APIs with Express.js and Node.js, and MongoDB for data storage. Used Postman for API testing to ensure seamless backend functionality.
